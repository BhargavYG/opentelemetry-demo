# Forking this Repository

This repository is designed to be forked and used as a tool to show off what you
are doing with OpenTelemetry.

Setting up a fork or a demo usually only requires overriding some environment
variables and possibly replacing some container images.

Live demos can be added to the [README](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L186)
